Hello,

This is a repo of examples on how to render graphics using the win32 api and the Odin languages.

All examples (unless specifically specified in the file) can be built and run using:

odin run .

Please keep in mind this repository is being used as a learning resource; meaning things I learn
are then placed in this repo, but only things in regards to graphics drawing/rendering with
the win32 api. 

This was originally started for learning game development, as such, more things like moving images around and sound may or may not be added to this repository as a result.
It is unclear how far this repository will go at this time and what direction it will take.
