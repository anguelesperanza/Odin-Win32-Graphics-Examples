/*
	This is an example on how to take in basic input with Win32 API and display the text to the screen.
	Technically, this uses GDI to display the text so really it should be in the GDI Examples.

	However, this is text. Text is complicated. Text is annoying. I can see a situation where I expand upon the text stuff one day. So
	I put it in its own folder to make things easier. And the focus isn't GDI directly.

	Since I've never done this before, I am sure there are way better ways of doing text in Win32. However, this is just to show a way of doing it;	not the best way.

	What this example does: Takes input typed on keyboard and displays it to the screen. There is backspace functionality to delete characters.
	It does this by using a dynamic array and addings characters to it to display, and popping the last character when backspace is pressed

	GetCharWidth32W does not exist in the Odin bindings (at least none that I can see). So I have to bind it myself.
	We need this to properly space out the text when displaying it. Otherwise one of two things happen:
		A) All the text renders on top of each other
		B) We manually supply a value for the spacing, and the text ends up looking weird because nothing is spaced correctly because characters are different lengths

	There is also: GetCharABCWidthsW
	This binding also does not exist in odin so it would need to be created, along with the ABC Struct that it needs as an argument.
	This turned out to be more complicated than what I was trying to do, and as such, I didn't go with this approach.


	DrawTextW. This is included in the odin bindings however I couldn't not find a way to manually set the x and y and it wasn't doing it automtaically.
	As such I went with TextOutW as I can set the x and y position
